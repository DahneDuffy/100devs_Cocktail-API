# 100devs_Cocktail-API

## Cocktail Recipe API App

This app allows the use to enter the spirit/liquor of their choice, and generate multiple cocktal recipes for that spirit/liquor.

## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Built an API call to retrieve data parsed as JSON from www.thecocktaildb.com, and used Javascript to dynamically populate said data into the DOM.

## Optimizations:

The second iteration includes functionality for instances where the API call returns more than one recipe.  

## Lessons Learned:

This was a good exercise in determining when buttons should and should not submit information.  There are still some issues in button functionality when the end of the JSON data array is reached, so I hope to solve that soon. In the third iteration I also hope to clean up some of the redundant references in my code, and make the CSS a bit cleaner.
